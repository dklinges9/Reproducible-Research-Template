## Sandbox

Directory for unfinished scripts, test scripts, various messiness. Most of the contents of this directory are ignored by the .gitignore, because there's no need to version control sandboxing scripts.  

For those files that are committed: apologies if things are a little disorganized. But that's somewhat the point.
